# this is personal org for sony device tree

- moving from my profile because there's too much sony project to do right now (and now my profile is full of mess)

# Status
- Mark 1 (Kumano) Have issues about hwc, and not booting. waiting for tester who can dump pmsg or console log or getting device
- Mark 2 (Edo) only having device tree for CLO based rom (only 5 II is supported) which is private for now.
- Mark 3 (Sagami) it already got well maintained on lineage, so only xpreia pro-i will be maintained
- Mark 4 (Nagara) development got halted, due to the people and also dev are busy
- Mark 5 (Yodo) Expeimental, DO NOT USE IT (except pdx234, but DO NOT USE sm8550-common)

- Seine (10 II) i don't have plan to support this, tbh
- Lena (10 III) will only maintain kernel, until i actually manage to bought device
- Murray (10 IV) is no longer supported

- PDX226 (ACE III) isn't support here due to missing dts

all of them is maintain by me
